## [Unreleased] — V0.7.0

### Added — 2026-06-28

#### Continuous Integration
- New `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs `npm run lint` and `npm run test` on every push and pull request targeting `dev` or `main`
- No secrets required — all 25 Vitest tests are fully mocked (Supabase + Resend), per `docs/Testing_strategy.md`

### Fixed — 2026-06-28

#### ESLint zero-error baseline (54 → 0 errors)
- Removed unnecessary `any` casts where `Profile`/`Project` types already covered the fields (`HiveCheckClient`, `ProjectDetailClient`, `ProfileClient`, `ConnectionsClient`, `profile/page.tsx`)
- Typed `catch` blocks as `unknown` instead of `any` (`post/page.tsx`, `RatingModal`)
- Typed Privacy toggle keys with an `as const` tuple instead of an `any` cast on `project`
- Moved `Chevron` components to module scope (`Feed.tsx`) so they're not recreated on every render
- Memoized the `activitySignal` calculation with `useMemo` (`ProjectCard`) instead of calling `Date.now()` impurely during render
- Memoized the Supabase client with `useMemo` (`ProjectCard`) to satisfy `exhaustive-deps` without introducing render loops
- Removed redundant `mounted` state + effect in the login/signup pages — unnecessary indirection around the auth state listener
- Computed the `BackButton` label via a `useState` initializer instead of `useEffect` + `setState`
- Derived `DocsSearchBox` results/open state from `query` via `useMemo` instead of syncing them through an effect; reset `activeIdx` using React's documented render-time state adjustment pattern
- Escaped unescaped quotes/apostrophes in JSX text (13 occurrences)
- Wrapped decorative `// the BuilderLab philosophy` text in `{''}` so it isn't parsed as a misplaced JSX comment
- Added `docs/**` to ESLint ignores — design handoff assets are not part of the application build

#### BackButton pointing to the wrong page after the marketing/app route split
- `ProjectDetailClient` now passes `fallback="/feed"` explicitly instead of relying on the default `/`, which now resolves to the marketing landing page
- `BackButton` compares the stored referrer against `/feed` instead of `/`
- `ProjectCard` stores `projectDetailFrom` as `/feed` instead of `/` when navigating into a project

### Changed — 2026-06-28

#### Component decomposition
- **`app/(marketing)/page.tsx`** split from ~720 lines into 8 files:
  - `components/marketing/home/shared.tsx` — `Wrap`, `BtnPrimary`, `BtnSoft`, `SectionHead`
  - `components/marketing/home/Hero.tsx`, `Strip.tsx`, `Problem.tsx`, `HowItWorks.tsx`, `Ecosystem.tsx`, `BuildInPublic.tsx`, `FinalCTA.tsx`
  - `page.tsx` now only assembles the sections and wraps them in `PageTransition` for a smooth fade-in on load, matching the rest of the app. `ScrollReveal` per-section behavior unchanged.
- **`components/ProjectDetailClient.tsx`** split from ~1050 lines into 7 files:
  - `components/ProjectDetail/shared.tsx` — shared card styles, `Member`/`Connection`/`AcceptedConnection` types, `getFullName`/`getInitials` helpers
  - `components/ProjectDetail/ProjectMilestonesCard.tsx` — milestones, Build Log, Team Chat
  - `components/ProjectDetail/sidebar/OwnerCard.tsx`, `TeamCard.tsx`, `DetailsCard.tsx`, `PrivacyCard.tsx`, `ProjectActions.tsx`
  - `ProjectDetailClient.tsx` now only owns state and Supabase mutations, delegating all rendering to the sub-components — reduced to ~330 lines

#### `.gitignore`
- Internal documentation policy changed from an explicit blocklist (listing every private file by name) to an allowlist: `docs/*` is ignored by default, with four files explicitly tracked — `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DATABASE.md`, `Testing_strategy.md`. This avoids revealing the names of internal/private docs (`ROADMAP.md`, `Product_Specs/`, strategy notes) through the `.gitignore` file itself.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added — 2026-06-14

#### Test harness (Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright)
- New devDependencies: `vitest`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `vite-tsconfig-paths`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/dom`, `@playwright/test`
- New scripts: `npm run test` (Vitest, single run), `npm run test:watch` (Vitest watch mode), `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright)
- New config: `vitest.config.mts`, `vitest.setup.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`
- Phase 1 test slice (25 Vitest tests + 1 Playwright smoke flow):
  - `app/api/contact/__tests__/route.test.ts` — validation, DB insert into `contact_messages`, Resend email
  - `app/api/notify/interest/__tests__/route.test.ts`, `app/api/notify/accepted/__tests__/route.test.ts`
  - `components/marketing/__tests__/MktNavbar.test.tsx` — auth-aware rendering
  - `lib/__tests__/timeLabel.test.ts`
  - `e2e/contact-form.spec.ts` — contact form submission end-to-end
- See [docs/Testing_strategy.md](Testing_strategy.md) for the full strategy, tooling rationale, and rollout plan

#### Contact message persistence (`app/api/contact/route.ts`)
- Contact form submissions are now saved to a new `contact_messages` table (in addition to the existing Resend email notification)
- New migration: `supabase/migrations/20260614000000_contact_messages.sql` — stores `name`, `email`, `subject`, `role`, `message`, `status` (`new`/`read`/`resolved`), `created_at`
- RLS enabled with no policies — only `supabaseAdmin` (service role) can read/write; entries are triaged via the Supabase Table Editor
- See [docs/DATABASE.md §3.15](DATABASE.md#315-contact_messages)

### Fixed — 2026-06-08

#### Docs search (`components/marketing/DocsSearchBox.tsx`)
- Search box was visual-only; now fully wired with client-side full-text search across all article titles, leads, and body content
- ⌘K / Ctrl+K focuses the input from anywhere on the page; Esc clears and closes
- Results show group label, article title, and a context snippet around the match
- `getSearchIndex()` and `DocSearchItem` type added to `lib/docs-content.ts` — strips HTML tags and exposes a flat, search-ready array

#### Auth pages split (`app/(app)/login/page.tsx`, `app/(app)/signup/page.tsx`)
- "Sign in" and "Sign up" buttons both previously routed to `/login`; now `Sign in → /login`, `Sign up → /signup`
- New `/signup` page pre-opens the Supabase Auth UI in `sign_up` view
- Middleware now redirects authenticated users away from `/signup` as well as `/login`

#### Contact email
- Form submissions now route to `rd.mouhouadi@gmail.com` (was `richiedieuveil@gmail.com`)

### Added — 2026-06-08

#### Auth-aware marketing navbar (`components/marketing/MktNavbar.tsx`)
- Detects Supabase session on mount via `getSession()`; subscribes to `onAuthStateChange` to stay in sync across tabs
- Logged-out state: "Sign in" (→ `/login`) + "Sign up" (→ `/signup`) buttons
- Logged-in state: "Projects" button (→ `/feed`) + circular avatar with user initials (→ `/profile`)
- Initials derived from `profiles.first_name` / `last_name`, falling back to `profiles.name`, then email prefix
- Both desktop and mobile hamburger menu adapt to auth state
- Navbar renders `null` until the session check completes to prevent button flash

#### Auth-aware landing page CTA (`components/marketing/PrimaryCtaButton.tsx`)
- New `'use client'` component replacing both static "Start building → /login" buttons on the landing page
- Shows "Start building → `/login`" for visitors, "Continue building → `/feed`" for logged-in users
- Defaults to the logged-out label on first render (avoids layout shift for the majority of visitors)
- Applied to both the hero CTA and the final CTA section

### Improved — 2026-06-08
- All French-language comments across 16 files translated to English
- All modified and core lib files now carry short beginner-friendly English comments

### Changed - 2026-06-06

#### Design system unification (`lib/design-tokens.ts`)
- **App backgrounds unified with marketing** — `bg.base/surface/elevated/hover` now use the same warm-dark palette as the marketing site (`#0a0d11 / #12181f / #161d27 / #1b232e`). The two halves of the product now share one visual foundation.
- **Accent section reorganized** — Teal tokens now have canonical marketing names (`base/deep/bright/ink/glowRgb`) alongside app aliases (`teal/tealText/tealDim/tealBorder`) with explicit cross-references. Indigo family expanded with `indigoDeep: '#4338CA'` and `indigoInk: '#1e1b4b'` to mirror teal's full three-level structure.
- **Font scale fixed** — `xs: 10px → 11px`, `sm: 11px → 12px` (below-11px text removed from the product). Logical ordering (`xs < sm < md < base < lg < xl < xxl`) now documented inline.

#### Navbar redesign (`components/Navbar.tsx`)
- **Height** — 44px → 64px (matches `layout.navHeight` and marketing navbar).
- **Background** — Opaque surface replaced by `rgba(10,13,17,0.80)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(14px) saturate(140%)`.
- **Layout** — Full-width → `maxWidth: 1200px` centered container with `32px` horizontal padding; logo/nav/actions use `space-between` with absolute-centered nav links.
- **Nav links** — Capsule wrapper (background + border + rounded container around all items) removed. Links are now flat, individual pill-shaped items (`radiusMkt.sm`, `fontSizeMkt.nav/14px`, `text.muted2` inactive → `text.base` active).
- **Buttons** — "Post project" uses the teal gradient + glow shadow matching the marketing primary CTA. "Log out" / "Sign in" use the marketing ghost style (border `mkt2`, `text.soft`).
- **Mobile menu** — Updated to match marketing hamburger menu style (warmer bg, flat link rows).

#### Connections page (`components/ConnectionsClient.tsx`)
- **Page width** — `maxWidth` 672px → 1152px (matches Feed and HiveCheck).
- **Font sizes** — Bumped throughout: page title `xxl/22px`, subtitle `base/14px`, tab labels and sender names `base/14px`, meta text `sm/12px`, action buttons `nav/14px`.
- **Cards** — `1px` borders using `border.mkt`, `radiusMkt.md` radii, `20px` padding, `38px` teal avatar.
- **Tabs** — Marketing-style segmented control (`radiusMkt.sm`, `1px` border, `text.base`/`text.muted2`).
- **Action buttons** — Larger padding (`7px 16px`), `radiusMkt.sm`, marketing ghost/semantic hover states.
- **Links** — Project name in "Interested in" and sent items are now clickable links to the project page.
- **Empty states** — Replaced bare text with emoji + headline + helper sub-text.

#### Profile page (`components/ProfileClient.tsx`)
- **Page width** — `maxWidth` 768px → 1152px (matches Feed and HiveCheck).

### Added - 2026-06-05

#### Hive Trio logo (`components/BuilderLabLogo.tsx`)
- **`BuilderLabMark`** — Reusable SVG icon component. Color variant: three-shade teal (gradient top cell `bright→deep`, mid BL, deep BR). Mono variant: `currentColor` at 1 / 0.8 / 0.6 opacity. Polygons shifted `translate(0,7)` to visually center the mark within its viewBox (hexagons occupy y=16–70 of 100; shift puts the visual center at y=50). `useId()` scopes each gradient ID so multiple logos on one page never collide.
- **`BuilderLabLogo`** — Horizontal lockup: mark + wordmark. Wordmark: Sora 700, `-0.03em` tracking, "Builder" in `text.base`, "Lab" in `accent.bright`. All colors routed through `design-tokens.ts` — no hardcoded hex values.

#### Favicon & browser icons
- **`public/favicon.svg`** — Hive Trio color mark available at `/favicon.svg`.
- **`app/icon.svg`** — Same SVG placed in `app/`; Next.js 13+ auto-serves it as the browser tab favicon, replacing the Vercel default.
- **`app/apple-icon.tsx`** — 180×180 PNG generated at request time via `ImageResponse` (Hive Trio mark as base64-encoded SVG `<img>`). Served at `/apple-touch-icon.png`.

#### Logo deployed site-wide
- **App navbar** — Hand-coded hexagon SVG placeholder replaced with `<BuilderLabLogo markSize={28} />`.
- **Marketing navbar** — `LogoMark` inline component removed; replaced with `<BuilderLabLogo markSize={28} />`.
- **Login page** — Green dot + plain text placeholder replaced with `<BuilderLabLogo markSize={32} />`; hardcoded background/border hex values replaced with design tokens.
- **Root layout** (`app/layout.tsx`) — Sora loaded globally via `next/font/google` (so the wordmark renders on app routes, not only marketing); both Inter and Sora exposed as `--font-inter` / `--font-sora` CSS variables on `<html>`; metadata description updated; `icons` config added.

### Added - 2026-06-03

#### Marketing Site (feat/landing-page)
- **Landing page `/`** — Full marketing home page: hero with two overlapping product screenshots (overlap layout), value strip, Problem/How it works/Ecosystem/Build in public sections, and a final CTA box.
- **Vision page `/vision`** — Mission statement, three-pillar section, build-in-public banner with principles, roadmap timeline, CTA.
- **Docs pages `/docs/[slug]`** — Real routes (not show/hide JS) with sticky sidebar (4 groups, 10 articles), prev/next navigation, breadcrumb, and scoped article typography.
- **Contact page `/contact`** — Client-side form with three subject chips (Suggestion / Bug report / Join the journey), conditional role `<select>` (shown on "Join the journey"), per-field required validation, and a subject-specific success state.
- **`/api/contact` route** — Resend API endpoint that emails `richiedieuveil@gmail.com` with the submitted form data.
- **Marketing Navbar** — Sticky blurred nav with logo, Vision/Docs/Contact links, Sign in / Sign up buttons. Hamburger menu below 880px.
- **Footer** — 4-column grid (brand + 3 link columns) with version badge. Collapses to 2 columns below 880px.
- **`ScrollReveal` component** — `IntersectionObserver`-based fade/translate-up animation gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`.
- **`Eyebrow` component** — Teal pill label with glowing dot.
- **`lib/docs-content.ts`** — Full docs content registry: `DOC_GROUPS`, `getArticle(slug)`, `getDefaultSlug()`, all 10 articles as HTML strings.
- **`lib/design-tokens.ts` extended** — Added `radiusMkt`, `fontSizeMkt`, `fontFamily`, `shadows`, `layout`, `breakpoints`, and new marketing-specific color values (`colors.bg.mkt*`, `colors.text.soft/dim`, `colors.accent.bright/base/ink/indigoBright`, `colors.border.accent`) without breaking existing app tokens.
- **`public/images/`** — Hero screenshots (`shot-projects.png`, `shot-login.png`) copied from design handoff.

#### Route Architecture Refactor
- **Route groups** — App now uses two route groups: `app/(marketing)/` (marketing layout) and `app/(app)/` (app layout with Navbar).
- **Root layout stripped** — `app/layout.tsx` is now a minimal shell (html/body/fonts/globals.css only, no Navbar).
- **Project feed moved** — `app/page.tsx` → `app/(app)/feed/page.tsx`; URL is now `/feed`.
- **All other app pages** moved into `app/(app)/` — URLs unchanged.
- **Proxy fix** — Authenticated `/login` users now redirect to `/feed` instead of `/`.

### Planned
- HiveCheck — structured peer review system
- Project submission for review (GitHub link, demo, description)
- Anonymous feedback from senior builders (3+ years experience)
- Public project leaderboard by domain and skill
- Reviewer reputation score

- **Navbar** — Archive tab replaced by HiveCheck tab with indigo beta badge.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Design system** — `lib/design-tokens.ts` — single source of truth for all colors, spacing, and style objects. No more hardcoded hex values in components.
