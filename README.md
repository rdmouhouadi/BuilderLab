## What is BuilderLab?

Nowadays, breaking into tech requires real projects — not tutorials, not toy apps, but portfolio-worthy projects that solve actual technical or business problems. That is hard to do alone, and even harder when you are not sure where to start.

BuilderLab is for **anyone who learns by building**: university students, bootcamp graduates, self-taught developers, career switchers, and online learners. If you are building skills and want to ship something real alongside people who are doing the same — this is your platform.

**builders are not defined by where they studied. They are defined by what they ship.**

**A typical use case:**
- A self-taught Data Science builder posts: *"I'd like to work on a concrete project in healthcare"*
- A bootcamp Software Engineer replies: *"Sounds interesting, want to collaborate?"*
- A UI/UX Designer learning online joins in: *"Is there room for one more?"*
- Together, they build something real — for their portfolios, and sometimes... for the world 🚀

**The app is live at:** [builderlab-tau.vercel.app](https://builderlab-tau.vercel.app)

## Vision — The Builder Ecosystem

BuilderLab is more than a project matching platform. It is being built as an end-to-end ecosystem for builders:

```
Find your team        →       Build together  →   Validate your project
(BuilderLab Core)                (HiveOS)              (HiveCheck)
```

Each layer builds on the previous one, serving the same community of builders at every stage of their journey.

### Build in Public — The Core Philosophy

BuilderLab is built around the **build in public** spirit. Projects, feedback, and team journeys are meant to be shared — not hidden away until they are "perfect."

On platforms like LinkedIn, students are often afraid to share work in progress. The fear of judgment from seniors or recruiters creates a culture of silence. BuilderLab is different: **everyone here is a builder, everyone is learning, and that shared context makes it safe to be transparent.**

Seeing how another builder received tough feedback and improved their project is often more valuable than any tutorial. The projects in the platform are not just deliverables — they are learning resources for the whole community.

> *A builder should never be embarrassed by something BuilderLab made public without their clear intent.* Transparency is encouraged, never forced.

**Key architectural decisions:**
- **Route groups** — `(marketing)/` and `(app)/` give each surface its own layout without affecting URLs
- **Server Components by default** — data fetching server-side for performance and SEO
- **Client Components only when needed** — interactive UI (forms, filters, modals)
- **Supabase RLS** — security enforced at the database level
- **Centralized design tokens** — all colors, spacing, typography defined once in `lib/design-tokens.ts`
- **Component decomposition** — large orchestrator components (project detail page, landing page) are kept under ~350 lines by extracting focused sub-components that receive props rather than owning their own state

## Roadmap

### V0.7.0 — HiveCheck ⭐
*Helping builders validate their work and grow through peer feedback.*

Builders submit their projects for structured peer review. The community rates projects on technical depth, problem clarity, and real-world relevance. A curated leaderboard surfaces the strongest projects by domain.

Public feedback threads mean anyone can read the reviews a project received — not just the submitter. Builders learn what makes a strong project by reading critiques of others. Reviews become content that builds itself over time.

- [ ] Project submission for peer review (GitHub link, demo, description)
- [ ] Structured review form (technical depth, clarity, relevance, overall score)
- [ ] Anonymous feedback — reviewers always anonymous to submitters
- [ ] Reviewer eligibility (3+ years experience, verified)
- [ ] Public project leaderboard by domain and skill
- [ ] "Top Project" badge on builder profiles
- [ ] Reviewer reputation score
- [ ] Public feedback threads — opt-in per project

> **Why this matters:** A project that has been reviewed and ranked by peers is far more credible in a portfolio than one that has not. HiveCheck turns BuilderLab into a quality signal, not just a matching platform.

---

## Quickstart

There are two ways to run BuilderLab locally: directly with `npm`, or inside Docker. Both connect to the same Supabase DEV cloud project — neither runs a local Postgres instance.

### Prerequisites
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account
- A [Resend](https://resend.com) account (for email notifications)
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (for deployment) — not needed for the Docker path
- **Option A:** Node.js 22+
- **Option B:** Docker + Docker Compose

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdmouhouadi/builderlab.git
cd builderlab
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

Create a new project on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), then run the SQL scripts in `/docs/sql/` in this order:

```
1. schema.sql        — creates all tables
2. rls.sql           — enables Row Level Security and policies
3. triggers.sql      — sets up automatic functions
4. seed.sql          — optional test data
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your-resend-key
```

### 4. Configure Supabase Auth

In **Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration**:

```
Site URL: http://localhost:3000
Redirect URLs: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

### 5. Run the app

**Option A — npm**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Option B — Docker**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

First run builds the image (a couple of minutes); subsequent runs are fast thanks to Docker's layer cache. Source code is mounted as a volume, so changes hot-reload exactly like `npm run dev` — there is no rebuild step for day-to-day development.

> **Note for Windows users:** if your repo lives on the Windows filesystem (`C:\Users\...`) rather than inside WSL2, file-watching performance through the Docker volume mount can be noticeably slower than native `npm run dev` — every file read/write crosses the Windows ↔ WSL2 ↔ container boundary. For day-to-day development on Windows, `npm run dev` (Option A) is recommended; Docker remains available for anyone who wants a fully reproducible environment without installing Node locally, or for CI/testing purposes.

Either way, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

### Environment variables — build-time vs. runtime

This distinction matters once you move beyond local development, particularly when building the Docker production image.

| Variable | When it's read | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | **Build time** — inlined into the JS bundle | `.env.local` (local) / Docker `--build-arg` (prod image) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | **Build time** — inlined into the JS bundle | `.env.local` (local) / Docker `--build-arg` (prod image) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | **Build time** — inlined into the JS bundle | `.env.local` (local) / Docker `--build-arg` (prod image) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **Runtime only** — read server-side on each request | `.env.local` (local) / `--env-file` or `docker-compose`'s `env_file` (prod) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | **Runtime only** — read server-side on each request | `.env.local` (local) / `--env-file` or `docker-compose`'s `env_file` (prod) |

Any variable prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is a Next.js convention meaning "safe to expose to the browser" — and as a consequence, Next.js bakes its value directly into the compiled JavaScript at `next build` time. It cannot be changed afterward without rebuilding. This is a framework constraint, not a BuilderLab-specific choice.

This is why the production Docker image is **rebuilt per environment** rather than configured at container startup — see [Building the production image](#building-the-production-image) below.

---

## Building the production image

The `Dockerfile`'s `runner` stage produces a minimal, self-contained image suitable for self-hosting outside of Vercel. It uses Next.js's [standalone output](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output) so the final image only ships the compiled server and its runtime dependencies — no source code, no dev tooling, no full `node_modules`.

### Build locally

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-prod-project.supabase.co \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-prod-anon-key \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com \
  -t builderlab:prod .
```

### Run it

Server-only secrets are passed at `docker run`, not baked into the image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.production.local builderlab:prod
```

Where `.env.production.local` contains:
```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-prod-service-role-key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your-resend-key
```

### Automated builds via CI

`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` builds and pushes this image to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** automatically whenever a version tag is pushed:

```bash
git tag v0.7.0
git push origin v0.7.0
```

The resulting image is published at:
```
ghcr.io/rdmouhouadi/builderlab:0.7.0
ghcr.io/rdmouhouadi/builderlab:latest
```

This requires three repository secrets to be set under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** before the workflow can build successfully — `PROD_NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `PROD_NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `PROD_NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — using values from the **production** Supabase project, since this image is the one intended for actual deployment.

### Self-hosting

On a server with Docker installed:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/rdmouhouadi/builderlab:0.7.0
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.production.local ghcr.io/rdmouhouadi/builderlab:0.7.0
```

A reverse proxy (Caddy, Nginx, or Traefik) is still needed in front of the container to handle HTTPS and a custom domain — Docker alone does not provide this.

By default, GHCR packages are private even on a public repository. To allow `docker pull` without authentication on the self-hosting server, either make the package public from its GitHub settings page, or run `docker login ghcr.io` on the server first.

---

## Testing

BuilderLab follows test-driven development. See [docs/Testing_strategy.md](docs/Testing_strategy.md) for the full strategy, tooling rationale, and rollout plan.

```bash
npm run test        # Vitest — unit, component, and API tests (single run)
npm run test:watch  # Vitest — watch mode for TDD
npm run test:e2e    # Playwright — E2E flows (requires dev server + DEV Supabase env)
```

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm run lint` and `npm run test` on every push and pull request targeting `dev` or `main`. No secrets are required — Supabase and Resend are fully mocked at this layer.
